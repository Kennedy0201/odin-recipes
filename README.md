# odin-recipes

This is my first html project. My goal is to practice the skills that I have learned thus far, including:
	*Setting up Boilerplate
	* Headings, Titles, Paragraphs
	* Bold and italics
	* Adding Links and Images (Relative/Absolute)
	* Adding Ordered/ Unordered Lists
	
The end product should include a homepage and multiple recipe pages.
***This file will be updated with css as part of another project***
