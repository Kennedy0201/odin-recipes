            <li>Line large cookie sheet with waxed paper. Crumble cake into large 
                bowl. Add frosting; mix well. Shape mixture into 42 
                (1 1/2-inch) balls; place on cookie sheet. Freeze about 
                1 hour or until firm. When firm, transfer to 
                refrigerator.</li>

            <li>In 2-quart microwavable bowl, microwave blue candy melts 
                uncovered on Medium (50%) 1 minute 30 seconds; stir. 
                Continue microwaving and stirring in 30-second 
                increments until melted and smooth.</li>

            <li>Remove one-third (14) of the cake balls from refrigerator. 
                Place on second waxed paper-lined cookie sheet. 
                Using 2 forks, dip and roll 1 cake ball at a time in 
                melted candy coating; gently shake off excess. Place 
                on lined cookie sheet. Immediately place candy eyeballs 
                on cake balls, and decorate with sprinkles. If candy 
                melts have cooled too much, reheat as needed. 
                Refrigerate coated cake balls 10 minutes.</li>
