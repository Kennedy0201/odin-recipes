        <h3>STEPS:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 350°F. Line 9-inch square pan with foil; 
                spray bottom and sides of foil with cooking spray. 
                Make brownie batter as directed on box. Spread in pan. 
                Bake brownies 24 to 26 minutes or until brownies are 
                set around sides and toothpick inserted in center 
                comes out almost clean. Cool 10 minutes.</li>

            <li>In medium bowl, beat cream cheese and pumpkin with 
                electric mixer on low speed until blended. Beat in 
                egg, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg until well mixed. 
                Gently pour and spread evenly over slightly cooled 
                brownies.</li>

            <li>Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until edges of pumpkin 
                layer are set and center is nearly set. Cool 
                completely, about 1 hour 30 minutes.</li>

            <li>In medium microwavable bowl, microwave whipping 
                cream uncovered on High 50 to 70 seconds or 
                until hot but not boiling. Stir in chocolate 
                until mixture is smooth; let stand 5 minutes 
                to cool and thicken slightly.</li>
